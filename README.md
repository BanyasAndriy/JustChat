# WebChat

I created this chat to gain development experience and to improve skills.
Key chat features:
 * private messages
 * creating groups for communication (editing the group name, deleting the group, deleting members if you are the group creator).

 Technology stack:
* Java Core
* Spring Core
* Spring Boot
* Spring MVC
* Spring Data JPA
* Spring Security
* Hibernate
* PostgreSql
* Maven
* WebSocket
* Rest API
* HTML/CSS/JS
* JQuery(AJAX)

At the moment I am optimizing the code and writing tests, so web chat is not hosted.
